## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SASS
-   Flexbox
-   BEM methodology

### Continued development

-   embed real-world best practices like responsive design, readable code, comments and use don't repeat yourself principles
-   mobile first approach
-   building re-useable components
-   honing html, sass and GIT version control skills

I attempted to try art direction responsive images in the HTML markup with the mobile and desktop image. Using <picture> <source> with the 'srceset' and 'media' atrributes. Either i couldn't get it to work or my browser was cached. So this is something to consider in the future. I don't think my image is the right colour of purple using a background image and gradient, i wanted to create a <div> with an overlay.
